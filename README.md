# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## 1. Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help predict successful investments for a company. I created a binary classifier that is able to determine whether applicants that are funded will be successful. I preprocessed a large dataset in order to then compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model. Lastly, I used various techniques to attempt to optimize the model and increase accuracy to 75%. 

## 2. Results
* Data Preprocessing
** The target variable is the IS_SUCCESSFUL variable. This column is used to determine whether the money was used effectively.
** The feature variables are APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, and SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS. 
** The variables that were removed from the input data were EIN and NAME. They are identification variables and have no impact on the target variable.
* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
